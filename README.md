# Deep-Learning-Coursera
My worked out Programming Solutions for the Deep Learning Course on Coursera. Will update the readme section for the other courses in a day or two. The solutions are meant to used only as a reference in order to save time when you are stuck on something and I strongly discourage copying them verbatim.
